## Intro Data Fundamentals.
1. Idenify data format:-
   we have three types of data structures namely:
   i. structure data-
   examples of structured data are data in table form or in a fixed schema(SQL) data.
   
   ii. semi-structure data-
   example of semi-structure data are json, csv etc
   
   iii. unstructured data
   example of unstructured data are picture, video, document etc.

2. Explore file storage:-
   There are different ways of storing data and below are some few ways of storing data.
   
   Dalimited text file: such as CSV, TVS and XLSX.
   
   Javascript Object Notation: json file
   
   Extensible Markup Language: XML

3. Explore Databases:
   we have two types of databases which are Rational and Non-Rational DataBases.

## Rational Data in Azure
1. Understanding relational Data:
   Relatioal data are in table format and houses structured data(SQL).

2. Explore SQL:
   SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it's use for programming language use for querying data that are in a rational databases     server.
 
 3. Describe Databases Object:
    in addititon to table(SQL), a relatonal Database can contain other structure that help optimize data and improvide the speed of access

## Non-Relational Data in Azure
1. Exploring Azure Blob Storage:
   Azure Blob is a container that enables you to store large amount of unstructred data in azure.

2. Exploring Azure DataLake Storage Gen2:
   Datalake Gen2 is use to store data in azure were data engineers can use these data in azure synapse analytics to query in data that       is stored in the datalake container.
